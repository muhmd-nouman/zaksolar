              All prices are listed in Pakistani Rupees (PKR) and are subject to change without notice. We accept
              various payment methods, including credit/debit cards, bank transfers, and cash on delivery for certain

              We offer same-day delivery to major cities across Pakistan for in-stock items ordered before 2:00 PM.
              Delivery to other areas may take 2-5 business days. Shipping costs are calculated based on the delivery

              Our installation services are performed by trained professionals. The customer is responsible for ensuring
              that their property meets the necessary requirements for solar installation. We will conduct a site
              assessment before installation to determine suitability. If we determine that your property is not
              suitable for solar installation, we reserve the right to refuse service.

              guaranteed for a period of one year from the date of installation. This guarantee covers workmanship only
              and does not cover damage caused by improper use, natural disasters, or unauthorized modifications.
            </p>
